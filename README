 Both mangband and mangclient binaries rely on "lib dir" - a directory
 with all the game data.

 First, they'll look for the ANGBAND_PATH environment variable,
 then they'll try the PKGDATADIR constant, then the directories
 specified in config files (.mangrc and mangband.cfg).
 
 PKGDATADIR is usually defined by system and ammounts to something 
 like "/usr/local/games/mangband", if you want to run mangband
 from the 'current' directory, that path is not for you.
 
 ANGBAND_PATH can be used to select any directory in this manner:

	ANGBAND_PATH=./lib ./mangband
	ANGBAND_PATH=./lib ./mangclient

  Config file directives consist of "LibDir" in ".mangrc" (for client)
  and "EDIT_DIR", "DATA_DIR", "SAVE_DIR", "BONE_DIR" , "HELP_DIR" in
  "mangband.cfg" (for server). Those overwrite any other paths.
